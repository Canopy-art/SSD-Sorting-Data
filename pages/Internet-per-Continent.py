# Explain Data
st.markdown(""" This graph shows the range of how much each continent uses the Internet. One can easily see that Europe and North America use the Internet the most, followed by South America and Asia. This makes sense because most content on the Internet is from North America (America and Canada), (Western)Europe, and East Asia.

### Possible Reasons For This
This lack of Internet usage in Africa, Oceania, and other locations like Central Asia and Eastern Europe is possilbly due to the lack of fiber optics cables in these regions.  Fiber optic cables are underwater cables that allow for information (the Internet) to travel between different continents. These cables are heavily focused in North America, Western Europe, and East Asia.

### Solutions
Possible solutions to this problem could be to lay down more of these cables in these other regions. This solution, although it appears most logical, could harm the underwater environment in these regions. A better solution could actually be to find an alternative to getting Internet access to these locations. Satellites or Fixed Wireless (Internet transmitted over radio) are possible solutions.
